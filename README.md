Inteligent-Plant

Inteligent-Plant is an innovative project that integrates artificial intelligence and sensor technology to monitor and respond to plant health and environmental conditions. By utilizing voice alerts and image recognition, the system provides real-time feedback to ensure optimal plant care.

Features

- Voice Alerts: The system delivers voice notifications regarding plant health and environmental status.
- Image Recognition: Utilizes computer vision to assess plant conditions and detect potential issues.
- Sensor Integration: Monitors environmental factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity.
